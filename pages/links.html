    <li><a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/about-the-scp-foundation">SCP wiki</a>: a fictional organization tasked with three goals: Secure, Contain, Protect. Here's one of my favorites: <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2317">SCP-2317</a>.</li>

  <h3>Books</h3>
  <p>(These are goodreads links, if you're aware of a decent non-amazon website to use instead, let me know.)
  <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56179360-light-from-uncommon-stars">Light from Uncommon Stars</a> by Ryka Aoki. My favorite book I've read this year, I cried a lot. Young trans runaway taken in by a violin teacher who's made a deal with the devil. Said teacher falls in lesbians with  donut shop ownser, an interstellar refugee in hiding. Greater than the sum of its parts.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/52569124-polysecure">Polysecure</a> by Jessica Fern: Generalizes attachment theory away from monogamy.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40855636-how-long-til-black-future-month">How Long 'til Black Future Month?</a> by N.K. Jemisin: amazing collection of speculative fiction. Suggest at least "The City Born Great".</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45154567-consciousness-medicine">Consciousness Medicine: Indigenous Wisdom, Entheogens, and Expanded States of Consciousness for Healing and Growth</a> by Fran√ßoise Bourzat: absolutely fantastic book from an experienced counselor and psychedelic guide who has significant training in the Mazatec tradition. I'm only interested academically, but I've gotten a lot out of her "holistic consciousness inventory." One thing that makes me want to suggest this book is that the vast majority of the chapters are dedicated to preparation and integration, with only one on journeying, in stark contrast to other books of the same type.</li>

  </ul>

<!--   <h3>Music</h3> -->
<!--   Here's some artists I like enough to put on a website. -->
<!--   <ul> -->
<!--     <li><a href="https://city-girl.bandcamp.com/">City Girl</a>: beautiful, relaxing music. Put <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axkOqrLtDXo">neon impasse</a> (youtube link) on while you're doing something else and see if it's your style.</li> -->
<!--     <li><a href="https://blankbanshee.bandcamp.com/">Blank Banshee</a>: some of my favorite vaporwave music. Listen to the album <a href="https://blankbanshee.bandcamp.com/album/blank-banshee-0">Blank Banshee 0</a> if you have time. If not, listen to the track <a href="https://blankbanshee.bandcamp.com/track/wavestep">wavestep</a>.</li> -->
<!--     <li><a href="https://yungbaebae.bandcamp.com/album/bae">Yung Bae, specifically the album "Bae."</a> Listen to <a href="https://yungbaebae.bandcamp.com/track/bae-city-rollaz-w-v">Bae City Rollaz (w/–òŒîŒ§V–ò)</a> to see if it's your thing.</li> -->

<!--     <h3>RSS Feeds</h3> -->
<!--     It turns out most things I care about have RSS feeds, even in 2019. If they're not linked on a site, you can often append <pre class="inlinecode"><code>/feed</code></pre> or <pre class="inlinecode"><code>/rss</code></pre> to a website's base URL to get one. -->
<!--     Here are the feeds I think are most worth telling people about. -->
<!--     <ul> -->
<!--       <li><a href="https://edavis.github.io/hnrss/">Hacker News RSS</a>: I use a URL for every post that reaches over 500 points <a href="https://hnrss.org/newest?points=500">here</a>.</li> -->
<!--       <li><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/feed/">Krebs On Security</a>: "In-depth security news and investigation."</li> -->
<!--       <li><a href="http://existentialcomics.com/rss.xml">Existential Comics</a>: funny philosophy comics.</li> -->
<!--     </ul> -->

<!--     <h3>Things That Cost Money</h3> -->
<!--     <ul> -->
<!--     <li><a href="https://nextcloud.com/athome/">Nextcloud</a>: host your own files, calendar, contacts, notes, etc. Costs money to run a server, unless you already have your own.</li> -->
<!--     <li><a href="http://www.thelazygeniuscollective.com/blog/how-to-bullet-journal">Bullet Journaling</a>: a hackable framework for a paper planner. I keep things to do in mine, but also lists of books to read, projects I'm working on, etc. Mine isn't pretty and isn't supposed to be, so don't feel like you have to be all artsy like the ones you see online.</li> -->
<!--     <li>A fountain pen: not hard to use, feels much better to write with than ballpoint, makes you look fancy with minimal effort. I have a <a href="https://www.twsbi.com/collections/fountain-pens/products/twsbi-eco-clear-fountain-pen">TWSBI ECO</a> extra fine (<a href="https://nibsmith.com/2015/07/31/twsbi-eco-review/">review</a>) and <a href="https://www.gouletpens.com/products/noodlers-heart-darkness-4-5oz-bottled-ink">Noodler's Heart of Darkness ink</a> (<a href="https://www.penaddict.com/blog/2013/12/20/noodlers-heart-of-darkness-review">review</a>). Together, they cost about $50 (USD). If you write things daily, it makes sense, IMO, to invest in your tools if you can.</li> -->
<!--     <li><a href="https://www.rotring.com/us/mechanical-pencils/290-rotring-600-mechanical-pencil-3501178523096.html#/color-black/nib_size-0_5_mm">Fancy mechanical pencil (Rotring 600)</a>: if pens aren't your style, check out this or similar pencils. Costs about $30 (USD). I use this and my fountain pen pretty much exclusively. Very solid, expect it to last many years to come.</li> -->
<!--     <li>Some good socks: my favorites are <a href="https://darntough.com/">Darn Tough</a> socks, with <a href="https://www.sockdreams.com/">sockdreams</a> coming in second. Pricier than normal socks, but they'll last longer, look better, and not be uncomfortable to wear.</li> -->
<!--   </ul> -->
