<h2>About Me</h2>

I'm a mostly self-taught software developer who enjoys making useful things, upstreaming fixes, and creating horrible hacks (prospective employers: said hacks are for my own amusement, I'm much more concerned about maintainable code when I'm being paid for it!).
I strive to live by the <a href="https://thethreevirtues.com/">three virtues of a great programmer.</a>
In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, reading, and getting deeply into new hobbies for a week or two.

All social media I use is not linked to this name; if you know me from elsewhere, feel free to ask for it.
